# prompt-blueprints  
Symbolic architectures between language and AI.

**This is not a prompt library. This is a mental interface.**

I design prompts as symbolic contracts between human intent and machine cognition.  
This repository is a structural preview — not a showcase of technique, but a hint of architecture.

Many of the actual components are withheld for strategic and commercial reasons.

- `/agent-dialogue/`  
  Thoughtful agent role prompts for GPT-style systems

- `/experimental-prompts/`  
  Analogy expansion, poetic logic, silence & tension modeling
